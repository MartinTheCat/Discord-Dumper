# Discord Dumper

A fully-featured channel dumper for Discord.

When running the dumper, specify the ID of the channel/guild/DM you would like to dump, like so:

    node index.js 222197033908436994

Since you must authenticate with the Discord API to read messages, you must specify a token. You can do this via the `DUMPER_TOKEN` environment variable.
